# ASP_E2EPO

A smart predict-then-optimize framework for the Aircraft Arrival Scheduling Problem (ASP) in terminal airspace. This project combines machine learning prediction with optimization techniques to improve arrival sequencing and scheduling of aircraft.

## ðŸš§ Under Construction 

This repository is currently under active development. 

<!-- The framework aims to:

- Predict transit times and operational costs using historical flight data
- Optimize arrival sequences considering wake turbulence separation requirements
- Integrate weather impact analysis on arrival scheduling
- Compare performance against First-Come-First-Served (FCFS) baseline
- Provide end-to-end learning through differentiable optimization -->

## Overview

The project uses a combination of:
- PyEPO (End-to-End Predict-then-Optimize framework)
- Gurobi optimization solver
- Deep learning models for transit time prediction
- Weather impact scoring system

More documentation and features coming soon!
